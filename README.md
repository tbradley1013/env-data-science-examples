# env-data-science-examples
Collection of Environmental Data Science Examples 

This repository contains different examples of environmental data science examples to use to teach and garner interest in both data science and environmental issues. These examples will attempt to tackle several introductory data science techniques with a focus on different environmental issues. 

This repository is organized by example. Each example will be contained in a separate folder. Each of these example folders will contain both a `data/` folder and a `R/` folder. The `data/` folder will contain the data needed for the example and the `R/` folder will contain some example R code for analyze this data. 

Currently, there are no python versions of the analyses, although hopefully they can be added later.
